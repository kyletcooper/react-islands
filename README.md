## React Islands

Created by Kyle Cooper at [WRD.agency](https://webresultsdirect.com)

React Islands is a way of introducing React into static pages. We developed React Islands as a way of introducing React-based interactivity sprinkled into places on WordPress sites (rendered via PHP).

The ReactIslandsWebpackPlugin automatically creates statically rendered mark-up for each Webpack entry point. This is rendered to a HTML file at build time which can then be hydrated using the `createIsland`.
